> Unit and e2e testing recipes for AngularJS

Even with AngularJS providing us a pretty testable way of work, we still need some boilerplate code (and some gotchas) to be able to exercise our code properly in our tests. This repository is a reference guide to help you to test your code.

## Setup

```
$ npm install && bower install
```

## Run tests

```
$ karma start
```
